A "browser" for viewing images associated with tags.

Presents a list of tags. Selecting a tag will show the first image
with that tag. Can cycle through all images with that tag.

To use:
1) Edit the IMAGES_BASE value to the path of the image set
2) execute `python tagview.py`


TODO (as of 20191211):
- view more than the first 100 tags
- filtering tags
- scrollable image view (when image is very large)
